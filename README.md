#Payment Gateway
This project is a simple dummy payment gateway designed to simulate the user experience of making an online payment. It provides a seamless flow for users to enter payment details and complete a transaction with a success confirmation. While it does not involve any real financial transactions, it mimics the essential steps in a payment process, including:

Mobile Number Validation: Ensures that users provide a valid 10-digit mobile number before proceeding to payment.
Address Validation: Users can enter their address details, and the gateway fetches city and state information based on the postal/ZIP code provided.
Payment Simulation: Users can choose a payment method, and after confirming, a success message and image are displayed, indicating that the payment was successful.
Success Confirmation: After clicking the "Pay" button, a success symbol and image appear, confirming the payment completion.
Modal with Close Option: A modal allows users to view details, and they can close it with a cross button to return to the previous section.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with a clean and responsive interface, this payment gateway is ideal for testing and demonstration purposes.
This gateway does not perform real transactions, making it perfect for educational, testing, or demo purposes.
